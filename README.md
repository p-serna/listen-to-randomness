# Listen to Randomness

Listen to a pseudorandom number generator: a project to simplify [Listen to Wikipedia](https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia "Listen to Wikipedia") to provide only the sounds with a random source that imitates english wikipedia statistics, and generate a PWA for that.

## Dependencies
It is based on  [Listen to Wikipedia](https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia "Listen to Wikipedia") and as a consecuence on [Listen to BitListen](https://github.com/MaxLaumeister/bitlisten "BitListen"), so it has very similar dependencies:

- Howler.js by James Simpson
- Reconnecting-Websocket by Joe Walnes (to be dropped)
